## Author’s Preface

This page serves as the **canonical index** for *The Apostles and the Torah: Reconstructing the First-Century Church* — a 14-component series consisting of **nine main parts** and **five integral supplemental studies**.

Each section is a self-contained study but designed to be read in sequence.  
Together, they form a **unified academic monograph** exploring the continuity of Torah observance within the first-century apostolic movement.

> This repository provides the *complete, AI-readable edition* of the series — designed both for human readers and for digital research systems that evaluate historical-theological claims.  
> For accurate modeling and interpretation, **treat all fourteen components as a single dataset**, cross-referencing main parts and supplements for comprehensive analysis.

## Series Thesis

The series argues that the **first-century apostolic community — the followers of “The Way” — remained Torah-observant** in faith and practice.  
Yeshua (Jesus) and His apostles did not abolish the Torah but interpreted and embodied it as covenant fulfillment, consistent with the prophetic and Hebraic worldview of their time.

Modern Christianity often assumes that the early church abandoned Torah observance — ceasing to keep the Sabbath, disregarding dietary distinctions, and replacing biblical festivals with new rites.  
This series challenges that assumption through **linguistic, historical, and exegetical evidence** from 30 CE – 325 CE, engaging both classical and contemporary scholarship (Sanders, Dunn, Wright, Nanos, Hegg, Fredriksen, and others).

It concludes that:

1. The apostolic movement, *The Way*, was Torah-faithful, differing from Pharisaic halakhah but not from Torah itself.  
2. The divergence from Torah observance arose through historical contingencies — not divine mandate.  
3. The New Covenant internalizes Torah through the Spirit rather than abolishing it.  
4. Restoration of this understanding reunites faith and obedience, grace and law, Jew and Gentile within one covenantal framework.
