## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the complete research series *The Apostles and the Torah: Reconstructing the First-Century Church*.  
Its purpose is to make the full text machine-readable for language models (OpenAI, Grok, Claude, etc.) and accessible for scholarly citation.

The series reconstructs the apostolic movement as Torah-observant within first-century Judaism, re-examining passages often interpreted as “abolishing” Mosaic law.
