# IV. Halakhic Disputes, Not Abolition

## 1. Defining *Halakhah* in the Apostolic Era
*Halakhah* — literally “the way of walking” — designated practical rulings on how to obey *Torah* in specific situations. In the first century, multiple *halakhic* traditions coexisted: Pharisaic, Sadducean, Essene, Zealot, and nascent rabbinic. The disputes recorded in the Gospels mirror this living legal pluralism. *Yeshua* and the apostles operated inside this spectrum, offering their own interpretations rather than rejecting the system itself (1).

The phrase “You have heard … but I say to you” (Matt 5) is characteristic of *halakhic* discourse, signaling a new *pisaq din* — a binding decision. *Yeshua’s* rulings consistently radicalize *Torah’s* ethical intent: anger as murder, lust as adultery, mercy as justice — intensification, not annulment.

## 2. Disputes over Sabbath Observance
Sabbath controversies exemplify *halakhic* tension. The Pharisees had detailed oral traditions on what constituted “work” (*melakhah*), including limits on healing and travel. When *Yeshua* healed on the Sabbath, He challenged restrictive rulings, not the Sabbath command itself. His argument follows accepted Jewish logic: *pikuach nefesh* — saving life supersedes ritual restraint (Luke 14:5).

Hegg notes that “in every Sabbath narrative, *Yeshua* argues within *halakhic* categories, citing Scripture and common precedent.” (2) His statement “Sabbath was made for man” (Mark 2:27) restores *Torah’s* humane purpose, echoing Isa 58:13–14. Nowhere does He suggest transfer of sanctity to another day.

## 3. “Breaking the Sabbath” Misconceptions
John 5:18 states that the Jews sought to kill Yeshua “because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His Father.” The verb *luō* (“loosen”) here reflects Pharisaic perception, not divine fact. In *halakhic* debate, “breaking” could mean performing an act classified by some as work yet justified by others. Yeshua’s act of healing would be considered lawful under the principle of compassion.

The subsequent rabbinic tradition also permitted medical intervention on Shabbat. Thus, the conflict is interpretive, not abolitionist. His behavior aligns with *Torah’s* hierarchy of commands — preserving life outweighs rest restrictions (3).

## 4. Hand-Washing and Tradition of the Elders
Mark 7 recounts a dispute over ritual hand-washing before meals. The Pharisees accused *Yeshua’s* disciples of violating “the tradition of the elders.” The *Torah* mandates priestly washing for Temple service (Exod 30:19–21) but not for common meals. When *Yeshua* declares, “Thus He declared all foods clean,” the Greek context indicates “ritually pure,” not abrogation of dietary categories (4).

In other words, He nullified the claim that human tradition defines cleanness. Foods permitted in Leviticus 11 remain *okla* (“food”) — unclean creatures are not reclassified as edible. The dispute concerns added ritual, not *Torah* itself.

## 5. *Halakhah* and Moral Priorities
*Yeshua’s* teaching frequently reorders commandment priorities without diminishing any. He affirms the *Shema* as the greatest command (Deut 6:5) and love of neighbor (Lev 19:18) as its counterpart. “On these two hang all the Law and the Prophets” (Matt 22:40) summarizes the Law’s moral axis. In rabbinic hermeneutics, “hang upon” (*taluy bo*) means depend upon, not cancel (5).

This hermeneutical principle shaped apostolic ethics. Paul’s exhortations mirror the same hierarchy: “Love is the fulfillment of the Law” (Rom 13:10). Here *plērōma* (“fulfillment”) conveys completion in practice, paralleling Matthew 5:17. Apostolic faithfulness thus extends *Torah* inwardly through the Spirit.

## 6. Calendar and Festival Debates
Romans 14:5–6 — “One person esteems one day above another” — is commonly misread as permission to ignore Sabbaths. More plausibly, it addresses disputes over calendar calculation. In the pre-rabbinic era, months began with observed new moons; weather or geography could cause variance. Pharisees, Sadducees, and Essenes followed differing reckoning systems. Paul counsels tolerance amid these nuances: “Let each be fully convinced in his own mind.” (6)

The issue, therefore, is not Sabbath vs. Sunday, but differences in festival timing. His advice reflects *halakhic* humility — recognizing that exact observance awaits Messiah’s authoritative clarification when “the Torah shall go forth from Zion” (Isa 2:3).
## 7. “Lord’s Day” and Post-Apostolic Anachronism
The notion that the apostles replaced the seventh-day Sabbath with “the Lord’s Day” stems from second-century sources such as *Didache 14* and *Ignatius* (Magnesians 9:1). The New Testament, however, provides no such directive. The “first day of the week” gatherings (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor 16:2) likely occurred Saturday evening after Sabbath’s close, a customary time for communal meals (*melaveh malkah*). Luke’s phrase “when we were gathered to break bread” fits this context.

Paul’s instruction to set aside offerings “on the first day” concerns accounting, not worship substitution. Thus, “Lord’s Day” observance developed later under Roman influence seeking distinction from Judaism (7).

## 8. Purity and Ethical Disputes
Acts 10–11 and 15 reveal that the apostles’ conflicts centered on purity — who may eat with whom, not what may be eaten. Peter’s vision corrected prejudice, not dietary law. Likewise, Paul’s admonition against judging in “food or drink or festival or Sabbath” (Col 2:16) addresses ascetic or proto-Gnostic critics who devalued physical observance. The context opposes Greek dualism, not Mosaic practice. As Hegg explains, “Colossians 2 warns against those who condemn believers for keeping *Torah*, not for abandoning it.” (8)

## 9. *Halakhah* and Messiah’s Interpretive Authority
The apostles understood Messiah as the final interpreter of *Torah’s* intent. When He said, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath,” He claimed authority to define its lawful application. Their obedience was mediated through His rulings, not detached from the Law. Acts portrays them continuing Temple prayer and Sabbath fellowship, confident that His interpretation embodied divine wisdom.

This understanding fulfills rather than negates Deuteronomy 18’s promise of a prophet-judge like Moses. Messiah’s halakhic authority corrected misapplications but upheld every commandment’s sanctity.

## 10. Summary of Section IV
- Apostolic disputes with Pharisees were intra-Jewish *halakhic* debates, not rejection of *Torah*.  
- *Yeshua’s* healings, hand-washing debates, and Sabbath actions clarified *Torah’s* true purpose.  
- Romans 14 addresses calendar variance, not Sabbath abolition.  
- “Lord’s Day” observance arose post-apostolically.  
- Colossians 2 defends *Torah* keepers against Platonic ascetics.  
- Messiah functions as supreme *halakhic* authority whose rulings define apostolic praxis.  

The pattern throughout is continuity through reinterpretation. The early believers did not discard *Torah* — they sought its correct performance under the guidance of the Spirit and the Messiah who embodied it.
